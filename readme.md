    "error": "Error message"
  }
  ```

## 🔐 Authentication
- Authentication is performed using JWT tokens 🔒
- To authenticate, send a POST request to `/auth/login` with the user's email and password in the request body: 📧🔑
  ```json
  {
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "password": "password123"
  }
  ```
- If the credentials are valid, the API will respond with a JWT token: ✅
  ```json
  {
    "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
  }
  ```
- Include the token in the `Authorization` header as `Bearer <token>` for authenticated requests🛡️
