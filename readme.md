# API Documentation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- .NET SDK installed
- SQL Server installed and running

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run `dotnet restore` to download the required packages
4. Update the connection string in `appsettings.json` to point to your SQL Server instance

### Running the Project
1. Open the project in your preferred IDE (e.g., Visual Studio, VSCode)
2. Run `dotnet run` to start the API
3. The API will be accessible at `http://localhost:5000`

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /auth/login` - User login. Returns a JWT token upon successful authentication.
- `POST /auth/register` - User registration

### Users
- `GET /users` - Get all users
- `GET /users/{id}` - Get user by ID
- `POST /users` - Create a new user
- `PUT /users/{id}` - Update user by ID
- `DELETE /users/{id}` - Delete user by ID

## Error Handling
- All endpoints return appropriate HTTP status codes
- Errors are returned as JSON in the following format:
  ```json
  {
    "error": "Error message"
  }
  ```

## Authentication
- Authentication is performed using JWT tokens
- To authenticate, send a POST request to `/auth/login` with the user's email and password in the request body:
  ```json
  {
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "password": "password123"
  }
  ```
- If the credentials are valid, the API will respond with a JWT token:
  ```json
  {
    "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
  }
  ```
- Include the token in the `Authorization` header as `Bearer <token>` for authenticated requests
